# Ahura-automatic-racer

This model uses an evolutionary algorithm to optimize a set of models for steering and accelaration of a racing car. The parameters of the models have been optimized on some tracks, while the agent can drive on any track. See some videos of the trained agent here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU79sUUkDXM, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mDqmLHKOao.
